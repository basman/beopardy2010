- abort question after every player gave wrong answer

- save/restore button states in/from save file
- one second delay between question display and button activation
- 1 second penalty if button pressed before activation

- entering player number for 'right answer' on the keyboard will leave all
  buttons active, despite the corresponding button should be sent to the
  Client. This is ok, because entering results manually means buttons are not
  used anyway.

- hardware disconnect robustness:
  1. start hwproxy and soundd
  2. start ./beopardy -tdfy Test.jg
  3. pick a question
  4. kill and restart hwproxy
  5. confirm serial fatal popup
  beopardy will no longer receive data from hwproxy ($tl->fileevent has to be set again in sub ser_eat (overwritten in sub ser_fatal)?)
