- restore button states after serial disconnect (use new command 1,2,3,4..)
- save/restore button states in/from save file
- one second delay between question display and button activation
- 1 second penalty if button pressed before activation

- entering player number for 'right answer' on the keyboard will leave all
  buttons active, despite the corresponding button should be sent to the
  Client. This is ok, because entering results manually means buttons are not
  used anyway.
